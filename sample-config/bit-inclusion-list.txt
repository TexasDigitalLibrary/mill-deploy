# Bit inclusion list
####################################################
# This allows you to include accounts,storage providers
# and spaces from a bit integrity run based on the 
# following format:
# /<subdomain | *>/<storeId | *>/<spaceId | *>
# For example the following formulation would 
# match any space in the "test" account across 
# providers with the name "test-space"
# /test/*/test-space
#
# Please note that by default  all accounts, providers,
# and spaces are included.  Any formulations entered
# in this file will automatically exclude everything 
# that is not included here.  Any exclusions defined in the
# exclusions file will be applied to the set of included
# spaces.
